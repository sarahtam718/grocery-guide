## What is grocery-guide?
Have you ever run out of prepped meals by mid-week? Over-bought items and they went bad? Lost your post-it note grocery list? Grocery Guide is an app that is designed to integrate your meal planning and grocery shopping. 

## How does grocery-guide work?
The user generates a list of items for all snacks and meals to prepare until the next grocery run. From that meals list, the user selects all the items that need to be purchased, and those items will be automatically added to the user's grocery list. When shopping, the user can "cross off" all the items purchased.

## What technology does grocery-guide use?
- Front-End: React.js
- Back-End: Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB

## What are some features that are under consideration to add to grocery-guide?
- add smart categories to the grocery list so that a user can sort their grocery list by areas in the store (and save time!)
- if multiple of the same item is needed for different meals, then add those amounts together in the grocery list
- track commonly purchased items
- lowest prices finder
- track per trip spending
